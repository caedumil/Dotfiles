# Files and directories #######################################################
#
# This setting controls the top directory which MPD will search to discover the
# available audio files and add them to the daemon's online database. This
# setting defaults to the XDG directory, otherwise the music directory will be
# be disabled and audio files will only be accepted over ipc socket (using
# file:// protocol) or streaming files over an accepted protocol.
#
music_directory "~/Music"
#
# This setting sets the.config/mpd/ internal playlist directory. The purpose of this
# directory is storage for playlists created by.config/mpd/. The server will use
# playlist files not created by the server but only if they are in the.config/mpd/
# format. This setting defaults to playlist saving being disabled.
#
playlist_directory "~/.local/share/mpd/playlists"
#
# This setting sets the location of the.config/mpd/ database. This file is used to
# load the database at server start up and store the database while the
# server is not up. This setting defaults to disabled which will allow
#.config/mpd/ to accept files over ipc socket (using file:// protocol) or streaming
# files over an accepted protocol.
#
db_file "~/.local/share/mpd/mpd.db"
#
# These settings are the locations for the daemon log files for the daemon.
# These logs are great for troubleshooting, depending on your log_level
# settings.
#
# The special value "syslog" makes.config/mpd/ use the local syslog daemon. This
# setting defaults to logging to syslog, otherwise logging is disabled.
#
log_file "~/.local/share/mpd/mpd.log"
#
# This setting sets the location of the file which stores the process ID
# for use of.config/mpd/ --kill and some init scripts. This setting is disabled by
# default and the pid file will not be stored.
#
pid_file "~/.local/share/mpd/mpd.pid"
#
# This setting sets the location of the file which contains information about
# most variables to get.config/mpd/ back into the same general shape it was in before
# it was brought down. This setting is disabled by default and the server
# state will be reset on server start up.
#
state_file "~/.local/share/mpd/mpdstate"
#
# The location of the sticker database.  This is a database which
# manages dynamic information attached to songs.
#
sticker_file "~/.local/share/mpd/sticker.sql"

# General music daemon options ################################################
#
# This setting specifies the user that MPD will run as. MPD should never run as
# root and you may use this setting to make MPD change its user ID after
# initialization. This setting is disabled by default and MPD is run as the
# current user.
#
#user "mpd"
#
# This setting specifies the group that MPD will run as. If not specified
# primary group of user specified with "user" setting will be used (if set).
# This is useful if MPD needs to be a member of group such as "audio" to
# have permission to use sound card.
#
#group "users"
#
# This setting sets the address for the daemon to listen on. Careful attention
# should be paid if this is assigned to anything other then the default, any.
# This setting can deny access to control of the daemon.
#
# For network
bind_to_address "127.0.0.1"
#
# And for Unix Socket
#bind_to_address        "~/.mpd/socket"
#
# This setting is the TCP port that is desired for the daemon to get assigned
# to.
#
port "6600"
#
# This setting controls the type of information which is logged. Available
# setting arguments are "default", "secure" or "verbose". The "verbose" setting
# argument is recommended for troubleshooting, though can quickly stretch
# available resources on limited hardware storage.
#
log_level "default"
#
# If you have a problem with your MP3s ending abruptly it is recommended that
# you set this argument to "no" to attempt to fix the problem. If this solves
# the problem, it is highly recommended to fix the MP3 files with vbrfix
# (available from <http://www.willwap.co.uk/Programs/vbrfix.php>), at which
# point gapless MP3 playback can be enabled.
#
gapless_mp3_playback "yes"
#
# This setting enables MPD to create playlists in a format usable by other
# music players.
#
save_absolute_paths_in_playlists "yes"
#
# This setting defines a list of tag types that will be extracted during the
# audio file discovery process. Optionally, 'comment' can be added to this
# list.
#
metadata_to_use "artist,album,title,track,name,genre,date,composer,performer,disc"
#
# This setting enables automatic update of MPD's database when files in
# music_directory are changed.
#
auto_update "yes"
#
# Limit the depth of the directories being watched, 0 means only watch
# the music directory itself.  There is no limit by default.
#
#auto_update_depth "3"

# Symbolic link behavior ######################################################
#
# If this setting is set to "yes", MPD will discover audio files by following
# symbolic links outside of the configured music_directory.
#
follow_outside_symlinks "yes"
#
# If this setting is set to "yes", MPD will discover audio files by following
# symbolic links inside of the configured music_directory.

# Audio Output ################################################################
#
# MPD supports various audio output types, as well as playing through multiple
# audio outputs at the same time, through multiple audio_output settings
# blocks. Setting this block is optional, though the server will only attempt
# autodetection for one sound card.
#
# See <http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Configuration#Audio_Outputs> for examples of
# other audio outputs.
#
# ALSA output:
#
#audio_output {
#    type "alsa"
#    name "My ALSA Device"
##    device "hw:0,0"           # optional
##    format "44100:16:2"       # optional
##    mixer_type "hardware"     # optional
#    mixer_device "default"     # optional
##    mixer_control "PCM"       # optional
##    mixer_index "0"           # optional

#
# This setting will change all decoded audio to be converted to the specified
# format before being passed to the audio outputs. By default, this setting is
# disabled.
#
#audio_output_format "44100:16:2"
#
# If MPD has been compiled with libsamplerate support, this setting specifies
# the sample rate converter to use.  Possible values can be found in the

# Resource Limitations ########################################################
#
# These settings are various limitations to prevent MPD from using too many
# resources. Generally, these settings should be minimized to prevent security
# risks, depending on the operating resources.
